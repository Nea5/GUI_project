#HelpPanel stuff, 2014-02-20

help_info = Information about usage:\nIn the application two different views are present: a list view and a calendar view. All events that are added are visible in both of these views.\n   To add an event press the button "New Task" or press "New Task" under the menu "File". A window appears where it is possible to give the new task a name, an date and time, a priority between 0 (lowest) and 9 (highest) and a category. Categories available are "School", "Work" and "Personal". \n   Under "Filter" it is possible to chose which categories that are to be displayed in the list view. When "Filter" is visible, all categories are shown.\n   When a task is overdue it is red in the list, and when it is marked as done it is green. In the calender view days with acitivites are marked with yellow. To mark an activity as done, mark the line in the list view and press the button "Mark as done". If an event is to be deleted or edited, it is marked in the list and the button "Delete" or "Edit" can then be chosen. These options are also available under the menu "Edit" when the task is marked.\n   Under "List" it is possible to choose "Week", "Month", "Done" and "Overdue". If one of these are chosen, a new window will appear listing events matching this criteria.\n   The application can be used with either English or Swedish, and the look and feel can be set to "Metal" or "Nimbus". The application must be restarted in order for the changes to take place.
